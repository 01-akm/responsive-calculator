This calculator is a fully responsive, full-page calculator built from the ground up using modern web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a clean, dark-themed interface that adapts seamlessly to any screen size, from mobile devices to large desktop monitors.

The core logic is encapsulated within a JavaScript class, ensuring the code is organized, maintainable, and free from the security risks of the eval() function. The user interface is crafted with CSS Grid for a robust and flexible layout, while dynamic font sizing ensures optimal readability on all devices. The calculator is fully interactive, supporting both mouse/touch input and a complete set of keyboard shortcuts for a fast and efficient user experience.
